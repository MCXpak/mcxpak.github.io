        <h2>📜 About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently a Data Engineer at Ford Credit 🚗 and a recent Robotics Engineering Graduate. 🦾
        </p>

        <p>
          My life's simple pleasures (outside of my hobbies) come from spending way too long on a problem and automating things that probably shouldn't need to be automated. ⚙️
        </p>

        <p>
          I aspire to always put passion and love to my projects. I enjoy programming the most out of all the components of my degree. I want to pursue a career in software engineering tackling the hardest challenges. 💻 </p>

        <h2>🦁 Event Participation</h2>
        <h2>Londond Business School Hackathon 2018</h2>
        <p>
          During my time at college, I have attended the London Business School Hackathon. I learnt so many things to list, but its one of my first real experiences under pressure when programming.

        <h2>Mozfest 2019</h2>
        <p>
          In 2019, I attended Mozfest where me and a few college friends produced a simple alexa app powered by AI to give feedback on your current mood based on some questions. It was simple, but it did gain attraction due to its interactivity and sprouted psychological discussions.
